# Thether
A server-less opensource minimalist social network in just one python file (can we get under 500 lines? backend is under 100!)


It is written in python and kvlang and uses raw sockets to comunicate. Apart from KivyMD, it don't use any other non builtin module for a lightwheigt experience.
